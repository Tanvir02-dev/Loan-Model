üè¶ Loan Approval Prediction
This project employs Logistic Regression and Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning) to predict whether a loan should be approved, using applicant data provided in a dataset.

üí† How to Use
Dataset Placement: Place your dataset file named loan_data.csv in the data/ directory.
Training the Models: Run the following command to train the models:
bash
python train.py
Launching the Streamlit Application: Use the following command to launch the Streamlit app for interactive use:
bash
streamlit run app.py
üìÇ Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data/: Stores the dataset (loan_data.csv).
models/: Contains the trained models after the training process.
src/: Includes modular code for tasks such as preprocessing, training, evaluation, and logging.
app.py: The entry point for the Streamlit web application.
train.py: The script used to train the machine learning models.

Here is a detailed explanation of the repository based on the given README.md file:

üè¶ Loan Approval Prediction
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting whether a loan should be approved based on applicant data. The project uses two machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression: A statistical model for binary classification problems.
Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning): A robust ensemble learning technique leveraging multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
The goal is to utilize these models to analyze a dataset of loan applicant data and make predictions regarding loan approval outcomes.

üí† How to Use
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Prepare the Dataset:

The dataset for this project should be named loan_data.csv.
Place it in the data/ folder of the repository.
Train the Models:

To train the models using the provided training script, run the following command:
bash
python train.py
This process will train the models using the data provided in the loan_data.csv file.
Launch the Streamlit Application:

Once the models are trained, you can interact with the project through a web interface powered by Streamlit.
Use the following command to run the Streamlit app:
bash
streamlit run app.py
This will launch an interactive application that allows users to test and explore the loan approval predictions.
üìÇ Folder Structure
The repository is structured into several folders and files for easy navigation and modularity:

data/:

This folder is where the dataset (loan_data.csv) should be placed.
Any input data required for the project is expected to be stored here.
models/:

After training the machine learning models, the trained model files are saved in this folder.
These files are used for making predictions during the application runtime.
src/:

This folder contains all the modular code for the project, such as:
Preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning and preparing the data.
Training: Code for training the machine learning models.
Evaluation: Functions for evaluating model performance.
Logging: Utilities for tracking and logging the training process.
app.py:

This is the entry point for the Streamlit application.
It defines the user interface and connects it with the trained models to provide predictions interactively.
train.py:

This script is responsible for training the machine learning models.
It uses the dataset provided in the data/ folder and saves the trained models in the models/ folder.
‚úÖ Requirements
To run this project successfully, you need to install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

Install Python (if not already installed).
Use the following command to install all the required Python libraries:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file lists all the libraries and their versions needed for the project.
Summary of Workflow
Prepare the dataset and place it in the data/ folder.
Train the machine learning models by running train.py.
Launch the Streamlit application using app.py to interactively view predictions.
